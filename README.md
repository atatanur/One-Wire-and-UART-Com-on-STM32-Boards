# One Wire and UART on STM32 Boards
This is a project done using a STM32F746G-DISCO and a NUCLEO-F401RE boards.

The main aim is to take values from 3 different temperature sensors using One Wire communication, printing these values on the LCD screen of STM32F746G-DISCO board while getting some values from the NUCLEO-F401RE board via UART communication and printing the taken values too.
